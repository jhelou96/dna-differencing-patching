# DNA sequences differencing and patching tool
A JAVA program that compares two DNA sequences based on the Wagner&Fisher algorithm and computes the edit script of the two sequences. The edit script is then later used to perform transformations from the first DNA sequence to the second and vice versa.

A detailed paper concerning this project along with different test cases can be found [here](http://joeyhelou.com/dna/dna.docx)
